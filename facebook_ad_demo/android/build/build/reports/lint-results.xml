        id="GradleCompatible"
        severity="Fatal"
        message="All com.android.support libraries must use the exact same version specification (mixing versions can lead to runtime crashes). Found versions 28.0.0, 27.1.1. Examples include `com.android.support:asynclayoutinflater:28.0.0` and `com.android.support:recyclerview-v7:27.1.1`"

        summary="Incompatible Gradle Versions"
        explanation="There are some combinations of libraries, or tools and libraries, that are incompatible, or can lead to bugs. One such incompatibility is compiling with a version of the Android support libraries that is not the latest version (or in particular, a version lower than your `targetSdkVersion`)."

        category="Correctness"
        priority="4"
        summary="Obsolete Gradle Dependency"
        explanation="This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version. However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is available, and that is what this lint check helps find."

        severity="Warning"
        message="Avoid using + in version numbers; can lead to unpredictable and unrepeatable builds (com.facebook.android:audience-network-sdk:5.+)"
        category="Correctness"
        priority="4"
        summary="Gradle Dynamic Version"
        explanation="Using `+` in dependencies lets you automatically pick up the latest available version rather than a specific, named version. However, this is not recommended; your builds are not repeatable; you may have tested with a slightly different version than what the build server used. (Using a dynamic version as the major version number is more problematic than using it in the minor version position.)"
